## Instructions

The Pixel art project allows the user to create a clean canvas with cells, and add color to it.
Steps:
1. The user starts by setting the grid height and grid width for their canvas and submitting it by clicking on the 'submit' button to create a plain canvas.
2. Nest, the user clicks on the pick color button to choose a color, and the clicks on any specific cell or cells to apply the color to.
The user can repeat this process for each individual cell. This will allow the user choose different colors for different cells.
3. To wipe of the color from the canvas, the user can click on the submit button to refresh the canvas. When this is done, a clean canvas with no color appears.
4. To change the size of the canvas, the user can set the grid height and grid width and click on the 'submi' button to execute the changes.
